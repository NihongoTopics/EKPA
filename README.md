# EKPA
EKPA is feature-based phonetic alphabet with phonology in mind. 

With EKPA you can
* represent a segment in terms of abstract phonological features instead of the IPA-style manner-place matrices
* be explict only for relevant features at each point of discussion 
* visualize phonological processes where the binary value of specific features are changed 
* in effect include variables (such as alpha and beta that you specify to be equal or unequal) in the representation of a segment
